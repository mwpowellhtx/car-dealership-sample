Progress thus far; will adjust as discoveries are made:

* most of the domain model is fleshed out;

* data layer migrations are set and working; could work on transactional unit of work material, but this will work for now...

next up:

* work on repository data layers,

* decompose service and controller layers,

* view and view model layers,

* may require third party like Autofac (or other DI), Automapper (for convenient DTO translations)

bonus round:

* decide whether and/or what sort of serialization is required, i.e. for wizardly navigation...
